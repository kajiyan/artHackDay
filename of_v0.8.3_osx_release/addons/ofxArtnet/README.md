**openframeworks** addon of libartnet

worked at below OSs.

Raspberrypi / 
OS X 10.7 and above / 
windows 7 VS2010

**Libartnet** is an implementation of the ArtNet protocol. ArtNet allows the
transmission of DMX and related data over IP networks.

##warning
* The addon is used with enttec ODE. But I suppose this will work with other artnet devices
